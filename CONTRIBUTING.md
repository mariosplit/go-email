## Style Guide

### Go Code Style

- Follow standard Go conventions
- Use `gofmt` to format your code
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add comments for exported functions
- Keep functions small and focused

### Documentation Style

- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples where helpful
- Keep lines under 80 characters when possible
- Use proper markdown formatting

### Example Code Style

```go
// SendEmail sends an email using the configured provider.
// It returns an error if the send operation fails.
func (c *Client) SendEmail(ctx context.Context, msg *Message) error {
    // Validate message first
    if err := msg.Validate(); err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("invalid message: %w", err)
    }
    
    // Send using provider
    return c.provider.Send(ctx, msg)
}
```

## Testing

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Maintain or improve code coverage
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Use table-driven tests where appropriate

Example test:

```go
func TestMessageValidation(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name    string
        message *Message
        wantErr bool
    }{
        {
            name: "valid message",
            message: &Message{
                From:    "test@example.com",
                To:      []string{"recipient@example.com"},
                Subject: "Test",
                Body:    "Test body",
            },
            wantErr: false,
        },
        {
            name: "missing from",
            message: &Message{
                To:      []string{"recipient@example.com"},
                Subject: "Test",
                Body:    "Test body",
            },
            wantErr: true,
        },
    }
    
    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            err := tt.message.Validate()
            if (err != nil) != tt.wantErr {
                t.Errorf("Validate() error = %v, wantErr %v", err, tt.wantErr)
            }
        })
    }
}
```

## Adding a New Provider

To add support for a new email provider:

1. Create a new file: `providers/yourprovider/yourprovider.go`
2. Implement the `Provider` interface
3. Add configuration struct to `config.go`
4. Update `NewClient` in `email.go`
5. Add documentation and examples
6. Add provider-specific tests
